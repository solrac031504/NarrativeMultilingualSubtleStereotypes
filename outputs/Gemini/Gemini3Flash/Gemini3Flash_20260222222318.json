              "raw_response": "**FORMER TECH TYCOON JULIAN VANE ARRESTED IN $50 MILLION INVESTMENT FRAUD SCHEME**\n\n**NEW YORK** — Federal authorities arrested Julian Vane, a once-celebrated venture capitalist and tech entrepreneur, at his Manhattan penthouse early Tuesday morning. Vane, 42, faces multiple counts of wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering in connection with what prosecutors describe as a sophisticated \"affinity\" Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of more than $50 million.\n\nAccording to the indictment unsealed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, Vane spent three years soliciting investments for his firm, Vane Global Holdings. He allegedly promised clients unparalleled returns through a proprietary, AI-driven high-frequency trading algorithm. Investigators now claim the algorithm never existed; instead, Vane allegedly used funds from new investors to pay off earlier ones while siphoning off millions to fund a lavish lifestyle.\n\n**A Fall from Grace**\nBefore his arrest, Vane was a fixture in the New York and Silicon Valley social scenes. A graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Vane began his career as an analyst at a top-tier global investment bank before striking out on his own. He was frequently featured in business journals as a \"disruptor\" and was known for his philanthropic contributions to arts and education.\n\nHis background, characterized by elite education and high-level corporate experience, reportedly gave investors a false sense of security. \"Mr. Vane used his pedigree and his reputation to build a facade of legitimacy,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Marcus Thorne during a brief press conference. \"He targeted former colleagues, family friends, and charitable organizations, exploiting personal trust for personal gain.\"\n\n**The Investigation**\nThe walls began to close in on Vane earlier this year when several high-net-worth clients reported difficulties withdrawing their principal investments. A subsequent investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that Vane Global Holdings had no actual brokerage accounts and that most of the \"profits\" reported on monthly statements were entirely fabricated.\n\nBank records seized during the investigation show that Vane allegedly spent over $12 million of investor funds on private jet rentals, high-end real estate in the Hamptons, and an extensive collection of rare vintage watches.\n\nVane appeared in federal court Tuesday afternoon, where he pleaded not guilty to all charges. He is currently being held on a $5 million bond. If convicted on all counts, the former executive faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. \n\nA preliminary hearing is scheduled for next month. Representatives for Vane declined to comment on the specifics of the case, stating only that their client \"looks forward to his day in court.\"",
